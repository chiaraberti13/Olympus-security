# Shared execution policy

`olympus.core.execution.ExecutionPolicy` is the common boundary around live or
resource-consuming work. It does not replace module-specific scope formats; it
standardizes the order and bounds in which every scope checker and adapter runs.

## Required order

1. Parse input without network or process execution.
2. Validate the execution policy and explicit authorization.
3. Apply the module's dedicated scope gate (domain/URL, resolved IP/CIDR,
   E.164 prefix, OUI, exact handle, or another reviewed dialect).
4. Check cancellation immediately before dispatch.
5. Execute through an injected adapter with the policy timeout, retry budget,
   concurrency, overall deadline, and rate interval.
6. Normalize real results into versioned contracts.
7. Persist a structured audit record after recursive secret/URL-query redaction.

Authorization must precede scope and scope must precede traffic. Discovered
pivots and HTTP redirects repeat scope validation immediately before their own
network action.

## Global bounds

| Setting | Accepted range |
| --- | --- |
| Per-operation timeout | 0.05–3600 seconds |
| Overall deadline | 0.05–86400 seconds |
| Concurrency | 1–64 |
| Retries | 0–5 additional attempts |
| Backoff | 0–60 seconds |
| Minimum request interval | 0–60 seconds |
| Jitter ratio | 0–1 (fraction of the interval/backoff to randomize by) |

Modules may impose tighter bounds. They must not silently clamp or widen an
invalid operator value. Retried actions must be read-only/idempotent and retry
only explicit transient failures.

## Run status and coverage

Every module that probes a target in a loop reports what it planned, what it
completed, and why the rest did not, through `olympus.core.coverage`. The
status (`clean`, `findings`, `partial`, `failed`) determines the process exit
code. See [run status and coverage](run-status.md).

## Cancellation and audit

`CancellationToken` is thread-safe and cooperative. Workers and adapters check
it before starting and between retry attempts; bounded transport/subprocess
timeouts remain mandatory because Python cannot forcibly stop an arbitrary
thread safely.

`StructuredAuditRecord` recursively redacts keys containing authorization,
cookie, credential, password, secret, token, API-key, or access-key markers.
Sensitive URL query values are replaced while non-sensitive routing context is
retained. Athena's narrower allowlist remains an additional protection and now
uses the same URL redactor before SQLite persistence.

## Adoption status

- Core HTTP: validated timeout/retry/backoff/rate policy and cooperative
  cancellation before dispatch/retry.
- ARGUS: shared authorization errors and shared account-concurrency validation;
  dedicated domain/IP/phone/OUI/handle/URL scope gates remain authoritative.
- Athena: plan limits become one shared policy; its formerly unused retry budget
  now drives transient adapter retries, cancellation tokens are issued per job,
  and audit URL queries are redacted before storage.
- Helios: the application service validates ports, requires explicit authorization,
  applies CIDR scope and an optional engagement port allowlist, probes with bounded
  concurrency under one overall deadline taken at the start, observes cancellation
  between probes, and emits versioned observations/findings for every probe — open,
  closed, filtered, unreachable, DNS failure, denied or out of budget. Scope denials
  use the shared redacted NDJSON audit format.
- Artemis: every active web command supplies an explicit policy to the DNS-pinned
  transport. Authorization and URL/IP scope precede DNS and traffic; redirects repeat
  scope checks; retries cover transport failures only; rate waits are jittered and each
  request obeys cancellation and one overall deadline taken at the start. No low-level
  network API assumes authorization. Requests that could not be made are counted with a
  reason rather than dropped, so a failed run never reports as clean — see
  [run status and coverage](run-status.md).
- Proteus: campaign creation requires explicit authorization at both application and
  domain boundaries. Engagement, sender, recipient domains and the HTTPS training origin
  are scope-checked before token generation; cancellation is cooperative, and structured
  audit records contain recipient hashes/domains rather than complete email addresses.
- Hermes: local scans do not invent an authorization requirement, but use shared strict
  timeout/deadline validation and cooperative cancellation. Working-tree enumeration,
  file bytes/counts, Git commits/output, process lifetime and generated artifacts are
  independently bounded; symlinks and non-regular explicit inputs fail closed.
- Apollo: offline evaluation does not invent authorization. Its application service applies
  shared deadline/cancellation checks while independently bounding rule/event files, stream
  bytes, physical records, evaluations and alerts; malformed records produce partial failure
  instead of silent loss, and symlink/non-regular inputs fail closed.
- Minerva: bounded no-follow alert/evidence/ledger reads and deadline/cancellation checks sit below
  Typer. Custody verification caps entries/bytes, rejects missing or partial chains, locks concurrent
  appenders and persists private digest-anchored entries atomically.
- Vulcan: all input files, aggregate bytes/items, output bytes and report/rank deadlines are bounded;
  complete producer envelopes are validated, cancellation is checked between records/renderers, and
  every output is preflighted then written with a unique fsynced atomic replacement.
- AEGIS adoption is tracked in
  `upgrade.md`; offline-only work uses the same validation/redaction pieces where
  applicable but does not invent network authorization requirements.
