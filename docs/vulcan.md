# Vulcan bounded aggregation and reporting

Vulcan is the offline reporting capstone. One application service loads shared
producer contracts, applies exact deduplication and severity filtering, builds
one canonical `olympus.security-report`, and renders JSON, Markdown and HTML
from that same timestamped model.

## Accepted inputs

Vulcan validates complete versioned envelopes and every nested object for:

- Argus assets and fronting results;
- Athena assessment results;
- Helios finding and observation/finding results;
- Apollo alert collections;
- existing Olympus security reports;
- direct versioned `Asset`, `Finding`, and `Alert` objects.

The original bare array or bare single-object forms remain one explicit legacy
adapter. Unsupported/wrong schemas, unknown envelope fields, incompatible
versions, symlinks, devices, malformed JSON and invalid nested objects fail.
Errors omit raw Pydantic input values.

Per-file bytes/items, aggregate bytes/items, file count, output bytes and the
overall deadline are finite. Defaults are 50 MB per file, 200 MB total input,
100 files, 100,000 items per file, 200,000 total items, 100 MB per output, and a
120-second report deadline. Input/output overlaps and duplicate output paths
fail before writing.

## Provenance and rendering

Assets, findings and alerts are deduplicated only when the same stable ID has
exactly the same contract. A conflicting repeated ID is an error; different
records with similar titles are retained, so evidence/remediation is never
silently lost. When an asset inventory is supplied, every finding must refer to
one of its asset IDs.

JSON, Markdown and self-contained HTML include assets, ranked findings and
alerts. Alert rule IDs and MITRE ATT&CK techniques survive the Apollo-to-report
path. HTML escapes every untrusted value and has no external assets; Markdown
collapses control whitespace and escapes active markup characters. Each file
uses a unique fsynced atomic replacement.

```bash
olympus vulcan rank --findings helios-findings.json --format json

olympus vulcan report --engagement ENG-2026-001 \
  --assets argus-assets.json \
  --findings helios-findings.json \
  --alerts apollo-alerts.json \
  --output report.json --markdown report.md --html report.html
```

Supplying JSON plus optional Markdown/HTML is prevalidated and rendered fully
before the first write. The individual atomic replacements are durable, but a
filesystem failure between separate output replacements cannot provide a
cross-file transaction; the canonical JSON report remains the machine source
of truth.
