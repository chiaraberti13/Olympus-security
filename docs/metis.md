# METIS — planning and cyber threat intelligence

METIS adds local, deterministic planning and CTI casework to Olympus. It does
not call an AI provider, run shell commands, or contact a target. Active work is
represented as a plan step with an explicit authorization state and is executed
only by the existing scope-aware Olympus modules.

## Capability routing

```bash
olympus metis capabilities
olympus metis recommend "correlate malware IOCs and write a CTI report"
olympus metis recommend "review incident evidence" --advisory-only
```

The scorer tokenizes the objective, weights exact catalog tags more heavily
than prose, and returns matched terms and a numeric score. The result is
repeatable and explainable.

## Engagement plans

Advisory/passive plan:

```bash
olympus metis plan "map the external domain exposure" --output plan.json
```

Include active capabilities only with an explicit request. A step stays
`authorization-required` until both a scope and confirmation are present:

```bash
olympus metis plan "scan the authorized web application" \
  --include-active \
  --scope https://lab.example \
  --i-am-authorized \
  --output plan.json
```

The plan is data, not execution. Operators can review it and then invoke the
listed Athena, AEGIS, Artemis, Helios or other commands themselves.

## CTI cases

```bash
olympus metis case init .metis/cases.sqlite3
CASE_ID=$(olympus metis case create .metis/cases.sqlite3 "Phishing cluster")
olympus metis case ingest .metis/cases.sqlite3 "$CASE_ID" evidence.txt \
  --source "mail-gateway export" --confidence 70
olympus metis case show .metis/cases.sqlite3 "$CASE_ID"
olympus metis case report .metis/cases.sqlite3 "$CASE_ID" report.md
```

Local ingestion recognizes and normalizes URLs, domains, email addresses,
IPv4/IPv6 addresses, CVEs and MD5/SHA-1/SHA-256 hashes, including common
`hxxp`/`[.]` defanging. It performs no enrichment request. Analysts can add
sourced findings and link indicator IDs; findings sharing an indicator are
correlated deterministically in the case document.

The SQLite database and exported reports are owner-only (`0600`), foreign keys
are enabled, inputs are bounded, evidence files must be regular non-symlink
files, and every finding retains source and confidence.

## Guided labs

```bash
olympus metis labs
olympus metis labs --level beginner --json
```

Labs are a small native catalog of reproducible Olympus workflows. They do not
download or execute third-party project repositories.

## Argus event pipeline

The complementary offline pipeline is configured independently:

```bash
olympus argus pipeline \
  --preset examples/input/argus-pipeline.json \
  --output pipeline.json \
  --audit pipeline.ndjson
```

Built-in modules map URL → host/domain, email → domain, subdomain → parent and
normalize phone metadata. The engine owns event identity, deduplication,
provenance edges, blacklist, maximum depth and maximum event count.
