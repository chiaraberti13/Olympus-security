"""Shared run status and coverage accounting for scanning modules.

A scanner that quietly drops the requests it could not make reports a clean
result for a target it never actually looked at. That is the most dangerous
failure mode a security tool has, so every module that probes a target in a
loop accounts for what it *planned* to do, what it *completed*, and what it
could not complete and why.

The vocabulary is deliberately small and shared:

``RunStatus``
    ``CLEAN`` — full coverage, nothing found.
    ``FINDINGS`` — full coverage, something found.
    ``PARTIAL`` — some units completed, some did not. Findings (if any) are
    still reported, but the absence of a finding proves nothing.
    ``FAILED`` — nothing completed; the result carries no information.

``FailureKind``
    Why a unit did not complete, in terms an operator can act on: a scope or
    policy denial is a configuration answer, a DNS failure is a resolution
    answer, a timeout is a network answer.

``PARTIAL`` outranks ``FINDINGS`` on purpose. A run that both found something
and lost coverage is incomplete first: the findings are printed either way,
but the exit code has to say the run cannot be trusted as exhaustive.
