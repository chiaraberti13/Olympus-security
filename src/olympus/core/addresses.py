"""One shared answer to "may Olympus connect to this IP address?".

``ipaddress.ip_address(...).is_global`` is close, but not close enough for an
SSRF guard. Several IPv6 forms embed an IPv4 address that the host stack will
happily route to a private destination, yet the wrapper itself is classified
as global:

* ``::ffff:127.0.0.1`` — IPv4-mapped (``is_global`` already says ``False``);
* ``::127.0.0.1`` — deprecated IPv4-compatible, ``is_global`` says **True**;
* ``64:ff9b::7f00:1`` — the well-known NAT64 prefix, ``is_global`` says **True**;
* ``2002:7f00:1::`` / Teredo — 6to4 and Teredo, which also carry an IPv4.

IPv6 multicast (``ff00::/8``) is likewise reported as global.

Everything that reaches the network therefore goes through
:func:`ensure_globally_routable`, which unwraps embedded IPv4 before judging.
