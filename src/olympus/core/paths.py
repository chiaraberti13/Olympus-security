"""Where Olympus writes when the operator did not say where.

Two kinds of file need two different homes, and neither may be inside the
source tree:

* **Audit and block logs** are written *implicitly*, as a side effect of a
  scope violation. The operator never asked for them and would not think to
  point ``--log`` somewhere, so they go to a per-user state directory that
  survives across working directories and never lands in a checkout.
* **Reports and exports** are the deliverable the operator asked for, so their
  default is a plain filename in the current directory — where the command was
  run, and where they will be looked for.

Defaults used to be ``examples/output/...``: paths relative to the process's
working directory that pointed straight into this repository's sample dataset.
Running the CLI from a checkout appended real engagement data to committed
example files, and the test suite modified tracked files as it ran.

The state directory follows the XDG base-directory spec and can be overridden
outright with ``OLYMPUS_STATE_DIR``. Note that CLI defaults read it once, at
import time — it is a deployment setting, not something to change mid-process.
