"""Canonical process exit codes shared across every Olympus command.

A single, documented convention so scripts and CI can branch on *why* a
command stopped, not just whether it failed:

===  ==========================================================================
0    success: full coverage, nothing to report
1    a finding/condition the caller may want to act on (e.g. secrets found)
2    usage or input error (bad flag, unreadable/invalid file, malformed scope)
3    blocked: the target is out of the authorized scope (and was logged)
4    refused: an authorization/consent flag was required but not given
5    partial: the run lost coverage; findings (if any) are not exhaustive
6    failed: nothing completed, so the result carries no information
7    cancelled: the run stopped on request before finishing
===  ==========================================================================

Codes 5 and 6 exist so a caller can tell "we looked everywhere and found
nothing" from "we could not look". A run that both produced findings and lost
coverage exits 5, not 1: the findings are still printed, but the run must not
be read as exhaustive. See :mod:`olympus.core.coverage` for how modules derive
that status.
