"""Scope enforcement for Argus IP OSINT.

IP intelligence only ever runs against explicitly authorized addresses. A
target IP is checked against a JSON allowlist of CIDR networks before any
lookup runs; anything outside the perimeter is blocked and the attempt is
appended to an audit log. Matching is CIDR containment, distinct from the
domain-suffix / E.164-prefix / handle matching of the other Argus scopes.
