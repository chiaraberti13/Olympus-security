"""Passive CDN/WAF fronting detection and origin-leak self-assessment.

Inspired by CloudFail's premise — a misconfigured domain can leak the origin
IP that hides behind a CDN/WAF — but rebuilt as a strictly *defensive* check.
It answers one question for an **authorized** domain: "is this domain fronted
by a CDN, and does any public record leak an IP that sits outside that CDN's
ranges?"

Unlike the tool that inspired it, this module:

* uses only passive, public data (DNS answers and Certificate Transparency
  subdomains that Argus already collects) — it never brute-forces guessed
  subdomains, never queries origin-exposing databases, and never uses Tor or
  any other evasion;
* never connects to a discovered candidate origin — it only *reports* the
  leak so the owner can fix the misconfiguration.

The bundled CDN ranges are a curated, published subset (not exhaustive); an
IP outside them is reported as a *candidate* leak to review, never as proof.
