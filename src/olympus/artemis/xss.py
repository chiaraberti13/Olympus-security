"""Non-destructive reflected-XSS *reflection* check for Artemis.

This probes a single URL parameter with a benign, unique marker that contains
the HTML-significant characters ``' " < >`` — but **no** script, event handler
or executable payload. If those characters come back **unescaped** in the
response body, the parameter reflects unsanitized input and is very likely
injectable; if they come back HTML-encoded, the app is escaping correctly and
nothing is flagged.

Deliberate safety choices (unlike the source tool this concept comes from):
- The marker is structural only — it never tries to execute anything.
- **No** WAF detection/evasion, no browser automation, no payload lists.
- One scoped GET through Artemis's DNS-pinned :func:`fetch_scoped` transport.
It is a first-pass reflection check: a positive result warrants manual
confirmation of the injection context.

A probe that never reached the parameter is reported as a failure, not as "no
reflection found": those two answers look identical in a findings list and mean
opposite things.
