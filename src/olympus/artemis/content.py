"""Authorized web content/directory discovery for Artemis.

A real, working content-discovery engine (the technique behind gobuster /
dirsearch / dirb): it requests a list of candidate paths under an authorized
base URL and reports which ones exist, so an operator can map the hidden
attack surface of a target they are **authorized** to test — and practise the
technique against a lab.

Safety is structural, not cosmetic:

* every candidate URL is re-checked against the Artemis scope before the
  request, so discovery can only ever touch authorized origins and path
  prefixes (out-of-scope candidates are blocked and audited);
* requests go through the DNS-pinned :func:`fetch_scoped` transport, are
  GET-only and bounded (timeout + max body), and never send a payload — this
  is discovery, not exploitation;
* it is rate-limited (with jitter) and capped, so it is not a stress/flood
  tool, and it stops at one overall deadline rather than per-request timeouts
  that add up.

Discovered paths become ``core.Finding`` records; a curated set of
sensitive names (``.git``, ``.env``, backups, admin panels…) is raised to
``LOW`` with remediation, everything else stays informational.

Candidates that could not be checked are **counted, not dropped**. A run whose
requests all failed used to return an empty list that reads exactly like "this
target has nothing hidden"; it now reports ``FAILED`` coverage with the reason,
so an operator can tell "nothing is there" from "we never looked".
