"""Typed ports (Protocol interfaces) the Athena application depends on.

The application layer talks only to these interfaces, never to concrete
infrastructure. Adapters (SQLite, audit sink, tool runners, reporting) and the
CLI wire real implementations in; tests wire in-memory doubles. Adapters
receive typed requests, not CLI argument arrays.
