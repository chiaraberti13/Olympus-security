"""Closed in-process adapter registry for Athena.

Adapter names in a plan are resolved here against a fixed set of factories.
Unknown names are rejected before an assessment is ever persisted, so a plan
can never reference an adapter that does not exist in this repository.

Adapters fall into two groups, and they must not share one HTTP client:

* *target* adapters connect to the engagement's own hosts, so their transport
  is pinned to the plan's authorized scope; and
* *service* adapters (DoH, RDAP) connect to fixed third-party lookup services
  that are never in the engagement scope, so their transport is pinned to
  exactly those service hosts.

Handing a service adapter the scoped client would break every lookup; handing a
target adapter the service client would let it reach outside the engagement.
