"""How far each scanner integration has actually been validated.

:mod:`olympus.integrations.capabilities` answers "can this engine run *here,
right now?*" — a question about the current machine. This module answers a
different and, for an honest catalogue, more important one: **how far has the
project itself taken this integration?** A binary installed on the operator's
laptop says nothing about whether Olympus owns a parser for it, whether that
parser was ever exercised against recorded output, or whether the pair was ever
run against a real engine.

The two axes are deliberately independent. An engine can be `live-tested` by
the project and still `dependency-missing` on this host; another can be
`available` here and remain `catalog-only`, because a `ScannerSpec` is a
product-catalogue entry, not an implementation.

The ladder, from least to most validated:

``catalog-only``
    A :class:`~olympus.integrations.scanners.ScannerSpec` exists. Nothing
    executes. This is the honest state of most of the catalogue.
``adapter-ready``
    A native adapter is registered in :mod:`olympus.aegis.registry`: Olympus can
    build the command line and has parser code. Neither has been proven.
``offline-tested``
    The parser is exercised against recorded real output, so a regression in it
    fails the build.
``live-tested``
    The adapter was run end to end against a real engine in an authorized lab
    and the captured evidence is committed.
``production-ready``
    Live-tested **and** the whole Definition of Done is met — evidence manifest
    with digests, SBOM, vulnerability scan, documented version compatibility.

Declarations are not taken on trust. :func:`verify_declarations` re-derives what
the repository can prove and reports every claim that outruns it; a unit test
asserts the result is empty, so this ledger cannot quietly drift into marketing.
