"""Locate the temporary legacy Vulnerability Assessment Platform boundary.

The full, unmodified VAP source currently lives under ``vendor/`` while its
remaining runtime surfaces migrate to native AEGIS. These helpers put the vendored
tool's root on ``sys.path`` on demand (only when the operator actually runs it)
so importing ``olympus`` never pulls in the heavy upstream dependency stacks.

The vendor directory is discovered relative to this file, or overridden with the
``OLYMPUS_VENDOR_DIR`` environment variable (useful when Olympus is installed
outside its source tree).
