"""Runtime capability inventory for the AEGIS professional control plane.

The catalogue deliberately separates four facts that older Olympus releases
collapsed into a single "scanner present" claim:

* catalogued: Olympus knows the engine and its deployment contract;
* adapted: Olympus owns an execution/parser adapter for the engine;
* available: the executable or API configuration is present;
* ready: adapted and available, therefore eligible for a live job.

A fifth fact travels alongside these and answers a different question:
``maturity`` (see :mod:`olympus.integrations.maturity`) says how far *the
project* has validated the integration — catalogue entry, registered adapter,
parser proven against recorded output, run against a real engine, or fully
production-ready. Readiness is about this host; maturity is about the code, and
an engine can be ready here while the project has never run it live.

No network request is made while building the inventory.  API-backed engines
are considered configured only when their endpoint and secret environment
variables are both present; connectivity is a separate, explicit health check.
