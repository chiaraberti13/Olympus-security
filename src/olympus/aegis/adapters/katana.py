"""Real katana adapter: parses ProjectDiscovery katana's JSONL crawl output.

katana is a crawler, not a vulnerability scanner: every endpoint it reaches is
attack surface, reported at INFO. What earns a higher severity is a *reachable*
endpoint whose path looks administrative, because "the admin panel answered 200
to an unauthenticated crawler" is a finding an operator wants surfaced rather
than buried in a list of URLs.

``-omit-raw`` and ``-omit-body`` are not an optimisation. Without them katana
embeds the full request and response — headers and body — in every record, and
that stream becomes the run's raw evidence. Response bodies routinely carry
session cookies, tokens and personal data, so the crawler is told not to emit
them in the first place rather than relying on downstream redaction.
