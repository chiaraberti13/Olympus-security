"""Real dalfox adapter: parses dalfox's JSON proof-of-concept output.

dalfox reports XSS proofs of concept. Its ``--format json`` emits a JSON array,
and a clean target produces ``[\\n{}]`` — a one-element array holding an empty
object, not an empty array. That quirk is the whole reason this parser exists in
the shape it does: a naive reader counts one element and reports a finding on a
target where nothing was found. Records without a payload are therefore dropped
before anything is built.

Every dalfox record is an *executed* proof of concept, so the payload it carries
is reflected attacker-controlled input. It is truncated and carried as evidence,
never interpolated into a title.
