"""Explicit execution states for AEGIS scanner adapters.

These states make the difference between a real scan, a missing dependency, a
failure, an intentionally-off scanner, and an explicitly-requested simulation
unambiguous — so the normal scan path can never present fabricated findings as
real scanner output.
