"""Durable, dependency-light AEGIS job control plane.

This module replaces the legacy VAP/Celery ownership boundary for local and
single-node deployments. SQLite owns job lifecycle, leases and cancellation
intent; the existing AEGIS application service remains the only path that may
execute an adapter, so authorization, scope, SSRF controls, audit and output
limits are not bypassed by queued work.

Three properties matter beyond "it stores rows":

* **Nothing is lost when a worker dies.** A claim is a *lease*, renewed by a
  heartbeat. When renewal stops, the job is requeued (or failed, if its attempt
  budget is spent) instead of sitting in ``running`` forever, and the worker
  that lost the lease is told to stop.
* **A state means one thing.** ``failed`` is a scanner that ran and failed;
  ``timed_out``, ``cancelled``, ``policy_denied`` and ``partial`` are not
  folded into it, so an operator can tell a broken scan from a refused one.
* **Persisted text is not a leak.** Errors are redacted before they are stored,
  and the job document exposes a scope *name*, never the server's filesystem
  layout.
