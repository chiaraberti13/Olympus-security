"""Bounded, non-destructive TCP surface discovery with explicit port states.

A boolean "is the port open" collapses five very different answers into one:
a refused connection, a silently dropped packet, a name that does not resolve,
a host with no route to it, and a probe the policy never allowed. An operator
reading "closed" for all five draws the wrong conclusion four times, so every
probe returns a :class:`PortState` instead.

Discovery stays non-destructive: Helios completes a TCP handshake and, when
banner reading is explicitly enabled, reads what the server volunteers. It
never sends application data.
